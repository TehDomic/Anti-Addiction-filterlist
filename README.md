# Anti-Addiction-filterlist

This filterlist project is for anyone who has removed their social media apps from their devices and switched to using the respective websites instead but also don't want to have any of the addictive elements of their website they use.
Such as votes, likes, resharing, related videos, YouTube comments, YouTube Shorts to name a few.

Suggestions and contributions to the project are welcome, I'll open up Issues or something in the near future.

Everyone is welcome to fork and use this list in their own filterlists.
